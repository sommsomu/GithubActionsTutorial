# Simplified Explanation:
# The rsync options in the ARGS string control how files are transferred and synchronized. Here's what each part does:

# -r: Copies directories recursively (includes all subdirectories and files).
# -l: Preserves symbolic links.
# -p: Preserves file permissions.
# -t: Preserves modification times.
# -D: Preserves device files and special files.
# -z: Compresses file data during transfer to save bandwidth.
# -v: Verbose output (shows detailed transfer information).
# --chmod=Du=rwx,Dg=rx,Do=rx,Fu=rw,Fg=r,Fo=r: Sets specific permissions on the destination:

# Directories (D): User (u) gets read/write/execute (rwx), group (g) and others (o) get read/execute (rx).
# Files (F): User gets read/write (rw), group and others get read-only (r).


# --delete: Deletes files in the destination that no longer exist in the source.
# --rsync-path='sudo rsync': Runs rsync with sudo on the remote server, ensuring elevated permissions.
